# General Purpose Preprocessor

## Introduction

Welcome to GPP, a generic preprocessor.

The `doc` subdirectory contains a Unix man page and an HTML page
describing how to use GPP. These files were generated by GPP from the
file gpp.pp, which can also be preprocessed to produce a LaTeX version
of the manual.  Only the man page is installed by default.

For building and installation instructions please see the `INSTALL`
file.

## Licensing

GPP is Free Software. Please see the file `COPYING` for details.
